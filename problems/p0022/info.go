	Description: []string{
		`Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing`,
		`over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then`,
		`working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its`,
		`alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.`,
		``,
		`For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is`,
		`worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would`,
		`obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.`,
		`What is the total of all the name scores in the file?`,
